- Robust Netlify Forms handling (URL-encoded POST + redirect fallback).
- Added `/success.html` and wired the form `action` to it.
- Footer standardized: © 2025 Kolega Construct Pty Ltd — ABN 57 664 054 675 — Adelaide, South Australia — Legal & Privacy.

## Deploy

## Image credit pattern
Add `data-credit` to any `<figure>`; a caption bar appears automatically.
